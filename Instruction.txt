1. Put the python file to dumbo:
scp /path/ABOD.py NetID@dumbo.hpc.nyu.edu:/home/NetID

2. Run pySpark on dumbo with the dataset for detecting outliers (the dataset has to be in the dumbo remote server):
spark-submit ABOD.py /user/NetID/path/38ib-pjw5.csv

3. Retrieve the result from remote dumbo to local dumbo:
hfs -getmerge abod_result.csv abod_38ib.csv

4.clear the remote dumbo memory:
hfs -rm -r abod_result.csv

5. Move the cleaned dataset from dumbo to local disk:
scp NetID@dumbo.hpc.nyu.edu:/home/NetID/abod_38ib.csv .
